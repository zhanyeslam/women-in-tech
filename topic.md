# Project Topic: Women in Tech and Their Startups

This project focuses on **female entrepreneurs in the tech industry**, especially those who have founded startups, and their social and economic contributions.

---

## üîé Identifying the Gap

Although platforms like **Wikidata** or **Crunchbase** provide data on startups and founders, information about **women in tech** is often:

- Sparse
- Incomplete
- Poorly linked

There‚Äôs also a **lack of semantic structure** showing how women-led startups contribute to innovation, inclusion, and impact.

We aim to fix that by creating RDF triples for:

- The founder (a woman)
- The startup and its domain (e.g. EdTech, AI)
- Country of origin / operation
- Social/economic impact (e.g. empowerment, education access)

---

## ‚ùì Why This Topic?

Women remain **underrepresented** in technology, especially in **leadership and entrepreneurship**. Making their work visible in structured data helps:

- Enrich public knowledge bases
- Enable semantic search and queries
- Expose gender gaps in innovation systems

---

## üß© What Will Be Modeled?

We will model and connect:

- **Female founders**  
- **Startups**  
- **Countries**  
- **Impact areas** (e.g. education, gender equity)

These will be linked using **RDF ontologies** and **SPARQL**, with data generated and enriched using **LLMs (Language Models)** to expand under-described entities (ABox level).
