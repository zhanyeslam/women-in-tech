# ü§ñ Prompting with Language Models (LLMs)

In this section, we explore how two different LLMs ‚Äî **GPT-4 (ChatGPT)** and **GitHub Copilot** ‚Äî respond to the same prompts related to the topic *Women in Tech*. We applied **three prompting techniques**: zero-shot, **chain-of-thought (CoT)**, and few-shot.

## üß† Prompting Technique 1: Zero-shot

### Prompt
> List 5 influential women in artificial intelligence with short bios.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                                   | GitHub Copilot Output             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Fei-Fei Li**      | Stanford professor, pioneer in computer vision and co-director of HAI                         | Computer vision expert            |
| **Joy Buolamwini**  | Founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, works on AI fairness                              | AI bias researcher                |
| **Daphne Koller**   | Co-founder of Coursera, expert in probabilistic models                                        | Machine learning                  |
| **Timnit Gebru**    | AI ethics researcher, co-founder of Black in AI                                               | AI ethics                         |
| **Rana el Kaliouby**| Co-founder of Affectiva, expert in emotion AI                                                 | Emotion recognition               |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 gave complete, contextual bios. Copilot returned short, functional descriptors. GPT-4 output is better for readers unfamiliar with the figures.

## üß† Prompting Technique 2: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

### Prompt
> Ada Lovelace is considered a pioneer in computing.  
> Let‚Äôs now think of modern women contributing to AI.  
> First, identify their area of expertise.  
> Then explain how they apply AI in that domain.  
> Finally, summarize each contribution in one sentence.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                 | GitHub Copilot Output         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Chelsea Finn**    | Expert in robotics and meta-learning. Applies AI to train robots across tasks. ‚ÄúChelsea Finn develops AI systems that allow robots to learn from few examples.‚Äù | Robotics and ML               |
| **Dina Machuve**    | Works in agriculture and AI. Uses machine learning to predict crop diseases. ‚ÄúDina Machuve applies AI to solve agricultural challenges in Africa.‚Äù | *(Not included)*              |
| **Kate Crawford**   | Specializes in AI ethics and its societal impact. Analyzes bias in large-scale models. ‚ÄúKate Crawford investigates how AI affects social justice.‚Äù | AI ethics                     |
| **Joy Buolamwini**  | Focuses on facial recognition bias. Created Algorithmic Justice League. ‚ÄúJoy Buolamwini challenges bias in AI systems.‚Äù | Algorithmic fairness          |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 followed the step-by-step reasoning well ‚Äî domain ‚Üí application ‚Üí contribution.  
Copilot produced flat outputs, ignoring the CoT structure and skipping logic progression.

## üß† Prompting Technique 3: Few-shot

### Prompt
> Example 1: Ada Lovelace ‚Äì Pioneer in computing.  
> Example 2: Margaret Hamilton ‚Äì Led software engineering for Apollo missions.  
> Example 3: Fei-Fei Li ‚Äì Computer vision at Stanford.  
> Now add 3 more examples.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                                  | GitHub Copilot Output   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Radia Perlman**   | Invented the spanning tree protocol, foundational to internet networking                    | Networking               |
| **Ginni Rometty**   | Former IBM CEO, promoted AI in enterprise                                                   | IBM CEO                  |
| **Cynthia Breazeal**| MIT researcher in social robotics and human-AI interaction                                  | Robotics                 |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 emphasizes historical contributions and academic roles.  
Copilot reflects examples with accurate names but minimal elaboration.

|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Output richness     | ‚úÖ Full bios with context       | ‚ûñ Keywords only               |
| Accuracy            | ‚úÖ High                        | ‚úÖ High, but limited detail    |
| Diversity           | ‚úÖ Global and academic breadth | ‚ûñ Repeats popular names       |
| Prompt sensitivity  | ‚úÖ Adapts tone and logic       | ‚ûñ Limited flexibility         |
| Use case fit        | ‚úÖ Best for writing and research | ‚úÖ Best for coding and drafts  |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

GPT-4 demonstrates a strong ability to generate nuanced, detailed, and diverse content suitable for analysis and educational purposes. GitHub Copilot, on the other hand, produces accurate but minimalistic outputs ‚Äî ideal for software environments and developers seeking fast completions.

Both models were effective, but GPT-4 was clearly superior for this research-driven project.
