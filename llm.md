# ü§ñ Prompting with Language Models (LLMs)

In this section, we explore how two different LLMs ‚Äî **GPT-4 (ChatGPT)** and **GitHub Copilot** ‚Äî respond to the same prompts related to the topic *Women in Tech*. We applied **three prompting techniques**: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot.

## üß† Prompting Technique 1: Zero-shot

### Prompt
> List 5 influential women in artificial intelligence with short bios.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                                   | GitHub Copilot Output             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Fei-Fei Li**      | Stanford professor, pioneer in computer vision and co-director of HAI                         | Computer vision expert            |
| **Joy Buolamwini**  | Founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, works on AI fairness                              | AI bias researcher                |
| **Daphne Koller**   | Co-founder of Coursera, expert in probabilistic models                                        | Machine learning                  |
| **Timnit Gebru**    | AI ethics researcher, co-founder of Black in AI                                               | AI ethics                         |
| **Rana el Kaliouby**| Co-founder of Affectiva, expert in emotion AI                                                 | Emotion recognition               |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 gave complete, contextual bios. Copilot returned short, functional descriptors. GPT-4 output is better for readers unfamiliar with the figures.

## üß† Prompting Technique 2: One-shot

### Prompt
> Example: Ada Lovelace ‚Äì Pioneer in computing.  
> Now list 3 modern women in AI with a short description.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                 | GitHub Copilot Output         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Chelsea Finn**    | Stanford researcher in robotics and meta-learning                           | Robotics and ML               |
| **Dina Machuve**    | Applies machine learning to agriculture in Africa                           | *(Not included)*              |
| **Kate Crawford**   | Studies the societal impact of AI                                           | AI ethics                     |
| **Joy Buolamwini**  | *(Not included)*                                                            | Algorithmic fairness          |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 shows broader geographic and academic variety.  
Copilot listed only known names, more concise but less diverse.

## üß† Prompting Technique 3: Few-shot

### Prompt
> Example 1: Ada Lovelace ‚Äì Pioneer in computing.  
> Example 2: Margaret Hamilton ‚Äì Led software engineering for Apollo missions.  
> Example 3: Fei-Fei Li ‚Äì Computer vision at Stanford.  
> Now add 3 more examples.

### Comparison Table

| Name               | GPT-4 Output                                                                                  | GitHub Copilot Output   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Radia Perlman**   | Invented the spanning tree protocol, foundational to internet networking                    | Networking               |
| **Ginni Rometty**   | Former IBM CEO, promoted AI in enterprise                                                   | IBM CEO                  |
| **Cynthia Breazeal**| MIT researcher in social robotics and human-AI interaction                                  | Robotics                 |

**Observation:**  
GPT-4 emphasizes historical contributions and academic roles.  
Copilot reflects examples with accurate names but minimal elaboration.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

GPT-4 demonstrates a strong ability to generate nuanced, detailed, and diverse content suitable for analysis and educational purposes. GitHub Copilot, on the other hand, produces accurate but minimalistic outputs ‚Äî ideal for software environments and developers seeking fast completions.

Both models were effective, but GPT-4 was clearly superior for this research-driven project.
