# KE4H Project: Women in Tech and Their Startups

Welcome to our semantic web project exploring how women-led startups can be modeled with RDF and enriched using LLMs.

This website presents the full project documentation, including:

- [📌 Topic](topic.md)
- [🛠️ Methodology](methodology.md)
- [💬 SPARQL & Prompts](sparql.md)
- [⚠️ Challenges](challenges.md)

We aim to:

- Identify gaps in structured data about female entrepreneurs
- Model key entities using RDF (startups, founders, impact, location)
- Generate new semantic data with LLMs
- Compare different prompting techniques and language models
